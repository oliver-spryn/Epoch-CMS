/*
 * This script is the super core of the system, which prepares the values from the
 * configuration script for use within the system. Here is an overview of this
 * relatively simple script:
 *  [1] The server is examined to see which operating system it is running, and will
 *      then define a constant giving the name of the operating system, and whether or
 *      not the operating system is Windows or *nix, to the rest of the application.
 *  [2] The server checks to see if at least PHP 5 is running, and also defines several
 *      constants which will make the major and minor versions avaliable to the
 *      system.
 *  [3] Check to see if the configuration script exists, and redirect to the installer
 *      if it does not.
 *  [4] Instantiate the "Config" class for use through out this script and system.
 *  [5] Check to see if the browser made a request via the HTTPS protocol, and set a
 *      constant to track this and other URL-related data.
 *  [6] Include the essential classes within the system's core.
 *  [7] Start a session.
 *  [8] Set several several configurations which will boost performance, improve
 *  	security, and allow certain actions.
 *  [9] Create a function which be used to import additional classes and packages into
 *  	a script for parsing, using ECMAScript standards.
